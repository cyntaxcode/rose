#Rose - Custom Home Screen Icons On ATV-3


## Why make software for a 2013 device?
Cause I can. I guess.

## Is more to come?
Yes, I hope to eventually get into actually making a usable package manager to some degree depending on the demand of these projects.

## Do you expect demand to be low?
Yes, I am not expecting many people to be using there old device for modern use cases but I do believe in the power of tinkering and maybe some use can come out of this project. I am currently also reviewing old ATV-2 NitoTV projects to make software properly.
